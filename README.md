# AudioPlayer

[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/audioplayer?period=total&units=international_system&left_color=black&right_color=orange&left_text=%20PyPI%20Download%20Stats)](https://pepy.tech/project/audioplayer)

**audioplayer** is a cross platform Python 3 package for playing sounds (mp3, wav, ...). It provides the key features of an audio player, such as opening a media file, playing (loop/block), pausing, resuming, stopping, and setting the playback volume.

I created this package to provide sound functionality to my game library [game2dboard](https://github.com/mjbrusso/game2dboard), but I decided to publish it separately.

Suported systems (see [full list](#suported-systems)):
- GNU/Linux (PC, Raspberry Pi, ...)
- Windows
- macOS

Inspired by (and with a few lines of codes from) the [playsound module](https://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound).

## Install

### Prerequisites

#### GNU/Linux
In Linux, you need to install PyGObject and others dependencies.

Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-gst-1.0 \
                     gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 \
                     gstreamer1.0-tools \
                     gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0 \
                     gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
                     gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
```

Redhat/Centos/Fedora:
```bash
sudo yum install -y python-gstreamer1 \
                    gstreamer1-plugins-good \
                    gstreamer1-plugins-ugly
```

#### macOS

In macOS, you need to install PyObjC bridge.

```bash
pip3 install PyObjC --user
```

### Install

The recommended way to install `audioplayer` is using the Python **pip** (or **pip3**) installer.

```
pip3 install audioplayer
```

If you don't have administrator privileges, install in your home folder.

```
pip3 install audioplayer --user
```


You can install the latest release by cloning this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjbrusso/audioplayer.git 
cd audioplayer
python3 setup.py install --user
```

### Usage

The API is documented [bellow](#API) and within the docstrings. 

After install, you can use this code to test (replace "path/to/somemusic.mp3"):

```python
from audioplayer import AudioPlayer

# Playback stops when the object is destroyed (GC'ed), so save a reference to the object for non-blocking playback.
AudioPlayer("path/to/somemusic.mp3").play(block=True)

```

## API

### Creation

- `audioplayer.AudioPlayer(filename)`<br>
  Creates the player.
    - `filename` : *str* â€“ The file name with extension  (.mp3, .wav, ...)
  
  Raise: `FileNotFoundError()` :  The file does not exist.

### Properties

- `filename` : *str*  (readonly)<br> 
  The file name as provided in the constructor.


- `fullfilename` : *str*  (readonly)<br> 
  The file name with full path.


- `volume` : *int* <br> 
  Gets or sets the current volume (in %) of the audio (0 â€” 100)

### Methods

- `play(loop=False, block=False)`<br>
  Starts audio playback.
    - `loop` (*bool*) â€“ Sets whether to repeat the track automatically when finished.
    - `block` (*bool*) â€“ If true, blocks the thread until playback ends.

  Raise: `AudioPlayerError()`: Failed to play.

- `pause()`<br>
  Pauses audio playback.

- `resume()`<br>
